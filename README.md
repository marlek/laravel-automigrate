# Laravel Automigrate

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/marlek/laravel-automigrate.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/marlek/laravel-automigrate)

Laravel package which allows automatically running migrations from different folders, useful when you have custom folder structure


## Installing

Require the package with composer:


    composer require marlek/laravel-automigrate


When the installation completes, open your `app/config/app.php` file and add this item
to the array of providers:


    'Marlek\LaravelAutomigrate\LaravelAutomigrateServiceProvider'


Finally you can run `artisan` command in the root of you application and see
`automigrate` in the list of artisan commands


    php artisan


## Using in Laravel

You need to define the list of migrations you want to run in the configuration
of the package. To do this, you first need to publish the configuration:


    php artisan vendor:publish


Then you need to open `app/config/laravel-automigrate.php`
file and pass `paths` array like this:


    <?php
        return [
            'paths' => [
                'path/to/migrations_folder_one',
                'path/to/migrations_folder_two'
            ]
        ];

Finally, the only thing left to do is run the command to migrate your database


    php artisan automigrate


## Using in Lumen

Since Lumen doesn't have `vendor:publish` command, you'll need to add package configuration yourself.

I recommend adding it in `bootstrap/app.php` like this:



    config(
        [
            'laravel-automigrate.paths' => [
                'path/to/migrations_folder_one',
                'path/to/migrations_folder_two'
            ]
        ]
    );


After this, just like in Laravel, you need to run the command to migrate your database


    php artisan automigrate


### Reset previous migrations

If you want to reset previous migrations before running migrate again, just
pass the `reset` option


    php artisan automigrate --reset


### Seed the database

Just like `migrate` command, this command accepts `seed` option, in case you want
to seed your database after the migrations


    php artisan automigrate --seed

---

Reset and seed can be combined into a command which will reset your migrations,
run all migrations again and after that seed the database


    php artisan automigrate --seed --reset


Regular `migrate` command will be run after all package migrations

### Older versions of Laravel

If you're using Laravel 4.* you should use the package version 1.2:

    composer require marlek/laravel-automigrate:1.2
